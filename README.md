**QUIZTREK**

This is an interactive quiz platform meant to help students and learners seek their potential.
It's designed to be reliable, engaging and user-friendly.

**For installation requirements:**

- pip install Flask   --> used for the web framework for the backend development
- pip install Pillow   --> used for resizing the images uploaded
- pip install pymongo  --> package to connect and interact with MongoDB
- pip install werkzeug  --> creates secured hashes (used for passwords, etc.)

**Note:** 
- I've set up a virtual environment so that installations and versions of packages or libraries are separate from other projects (also makes it easier to deploy -- which I plan on doing later for hosting)
- Two of the pages such as 'Contact' and 'Settings' return to the home page as they haven't been created
- The delete function during create and edit mode seems to be deleting the filled options of all questions instead of only one --> a glitch that needs to be fixed later
- Plan on making the create and edit modes more user-friendly and interactive (kind of like Kahoot)
- Plan on adding a timer during game mode and perhaps a leaderboard

**Credits:**
- Coding2Go YT channel
- Elisha Clarke-Rootham (for project idea)

**Inspiration:**
- Kahoot
